Many of the implementations in the MlFinLab package are based on the works of professor Lopez de Prado. We are grateful
to the professor for his great works and support in the development of our package. We encourage you to read the original
works, a full list of which can be found on `QuantResearch <https://www.quantresearch.org/index.html>`__.

Our package is mainly based upon the books:

* "Advances in Financial Machine Learning" *by* Lopez de Prado;
* "Machine Learning for Asset Managers" *by* Lopez de Prado.

You can find links to these books as well as links to peer-reviewed journal articles, working papers and many more
on the professor's webpage `QuantResearch <https://www.quantresearch.org/index.html>`__.

.. Note::

    According to professor Lopez de Prado:

    *"This website [* `QuantResearch <https://www.quantresearch.org/index.html>`__ *] explains scientifically sound ML tools that have worked for me over the course of two decades,*
    *helping me to manage large pools of funds for some of the most demanding institutional investors."*
